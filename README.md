These are the final projects focused on solving the maze problem using multiple algorithms:

Maze Problem Solver: This project compares the performance of Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), A*, and Reinforcement Learning (RL) across various maze configurations.
Multi-Agent Maze Solver: This project leverages Reinforcement Learning (RL) to accelerate maze-solving in environments with fog of war, where agents must collaborate to navigate and uncover the maze efficiently.
